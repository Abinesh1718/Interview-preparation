REDUX BASED INTERBIEW QUSTIONS

Here are some Redux-based interview questions:

1. **What is Redux, and why would you use it in a React application?**
   - Discuss the purpose of Redux and its benefits in managing application state, especially in large and complex applications.

2. **Explain the core principles of Redux.**
   - Discuss concepts such as single source of truth, state immutability, and pure functions in the context of Redux.

3. **What are the three main components of a Redux application?**
   - Discuss the role of actions, reducers, and the store in a Redux application and how they interact with each other.

4. **Describe the flow of data in a Redux application when an action is dispatched.**
   - Explain how an action flows through the Redux architecture, triggers a state change, and updates the UI.

5. **What is an action creator in Redux?**
   - Discuss the purpose of action creators in Redux and how they are used to create actions that represent state changes.

6. **Explain the concept of reducers in Redux.**
   - Discuss how reducers are responsible for handling state changes based on dispatched actions and returning a new state.

7. **What is the Redux store, and what does it contain?**
   - Describe the role of the Redux store in storing the application state and providing methods to access and update the state.

8. **What is the difference between mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps?**
   - Discuss the purpose of mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps in connecting Redux state and actions to React components.
